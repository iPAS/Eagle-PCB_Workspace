1) Have you verified that the BOM in Sparkle is accurate (also checking for PROD_ID, NAME, VALUE, PREFIX)? [NO]
comment: No, I haven't created a sparkle page for this product yet. It will probably be a clone of the SparkX version. 

2) Is the I2C address in the schematic? [n/a]
comment: N/A - this is an I2C master

3) Is the I2C pin order correct (GND/VCC/SDA/CLK) and did you consider using a Qwiic connector? [YES]
comment: Qwiic connector used

4) Is the I2C pull-up resistor isolation jumper present? [NO]
comment: No, this is a master. All downstream devices will have isolation option. Discussed with Nate

5) Is the SPI pull-up resistor for Chip Select present? [NO]
comment: No. There could be a CS PU on the RFM_CS net but this board is so jam-packed and that line is not broken out so I'm comfortable leaving it up to the ESP to push/pull that line

6) Are active low pins labeled clearly? [NO]
comment: RST is not, but this board is very tight
